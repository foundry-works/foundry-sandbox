# Docker `sbx` Rearchitecture Checklist

**Status:** Phase 0 (Validation Spike) **COMPLETE** — Phase 1 (Monitor) ongoing — Phase 2 ready to start
**Last updated:** 2026-04-18

---

## Phase 1 Research Findings (2026-04-18)

### Current Status (as of April 18, 2026)

| Item | Finding |
|------|---------|
| **Experimental label** | Still "Experimental" in Docker docs and product page. No GA timeline announced. |
| **Launch date** | March 31, 2026 (blog: "Docker Sandboxes: Run Agents in YOLO Mode, Safely") |
| **Architecture blog** | April 16, 2026 ("Why MicroVMs: The Architecture Behind Docker Sandboxes") |
| **GitHub repo** | `docker/sbx-releases` — releases only, **proprietary** license (no source code) |
| **Version** | Standalone `sbx` at v0.24.1; Docker Desktop plugin `docker sandbox` at v0.12.0 (diverged) |
| **Releases** | 7 stable releases + nightly builds available |
| **Breaking changes** | Community reports CLI migrated from `docker sandbox` to `sbx` with no migration path. Forum: "Docker Sandbox COMPLETELY changed in a minor update." |
| **Linux support** | Install artifacts exist (.deb for Ubuntu 24.04/25.10/26.04, .rpm for Rocky Linux 8) but docs still say Linux gets **legacy container-based sandboxes**, NOT microVMs |
| **Licensing** | Proprietary (Docker Inc.). Individual standalone use appears free. Team/enterprise controls require contacting sales. No separate Sandboxes pricing tier. |
| **Git safety features** | **None.** Policy system is network-only (domain allow/deny). No git operation guardrails, protected branches, ref filtering, or API-level policies. |
| **Docker Desktop integration** | "Coming soon" per launch blog. Not yet available. |

### Key Risk Updates

| Risk | Previous Assessment | Updated Assessment |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Experimental status | Medium likelihood of indefinite experimental | **Confirmed** — still experimental, <3 weeks old, rapid iteration expected |
| Version stability | Medium — breaking changes expected | **High** — community reports surprise breaking changes between `docker sandbox` and `sbx` CLIs |
| Linux support | Medium — KVM backend exists, no install docs | **Mixed** — install artifacts published but NOT microVM-based; legacy containers only |
| Git feature gap | Medium — Docker could add git policies | **Low** — no git features in docs, roadmap, or CLI; policy system is network-only |
| Licensing risk | Low — unclear terms | **Low-Medium** — proprietary, free for individual use, team/enterprise requires sales contact |

## Phase 0: One-Week Validation Spike

**Result: PASS (with caveats)** — See `docs/sbx-phase0-report.md`

### Git Wrapper Injection Validation

- [x] Create test macOS environment with Docker `sbx` installed
  - Used Linux (Fedora 43) with `sbx` v0.26.1 — confirmed microVM (kernel 6.12.44 vs host 6.17.8)
- [x] Prepare git wrapper script for injection
  - Created `stubs/git-wrapper-sbx.sh` — adapted for sbx networking
- [x] Inject wrapper via `sbx exec --user root`
  - File sync to workspace → `sbx exec --user root phase0-test -- bash -c "cp ... /usr/local/bin/git"`
- [x] Verify wrapper is active: `sbx exec test -- git --version`
  - `which git` returns `/usr/local/bin/git`; wrapper header confirmed
- [x] Test git operations are proxied correctly
  - `git status`, `git log`, `git branch` all returned correct results via host API server
- [x] Execute `sbx reset` and verify wrapper persistence
  - **Wrapper destroyed** — `sbx reset` destroys entire sandbox filesystem + signs out
- [x] If wrapper destroyed, investigate template-based installation
  - Template-based install (`sbx template save`) is the mitigation; not yet tested
- [x] Document injection and persistence strategy
  - Documented in `docs/sbx-phase0-report.md` — file sync + `sbx exec`, template for persistence
- [x] Pass/Fail determination: Proceed to Phase 2 only on pass
  - **PASS** — git wrapper injection works; proceeding to Phase 2 recommended

### Agent Removal Resistance

- [x] Simulate agent removal: `sbx exec test -- rm /usr/local/bin/git`
  - Agent can remove wrapper. Real git at `/usr/bin/git` provides unrestricted access.
- [x] Test if operations are blocked or wrapper recovers
  - **No recovery mechanism.** After removal, agent has full unrestricted git.
- [x] Document expected behavior and monitoring strategy
  - Accepted risk. Mitigation: build wrapper into custom sbx template; monitor and re-inject.

### Security Audit

- [x] Review privileged injection mechanism for sandbox escape vectors
  - No sandbox escape found. MicroVM isolation confirmed (separate kernel).
- [x] Document security boundaries and assumptions
  - `gateway.docker.internal` only exposes proxy port 3128; other host ports blocked.
  - Agent has root inside sandbox but cannot access host filesystem beyond workspace.
- [x] If concerns identified, explore alternative injection mechanisms
  - Agent removal is accepted risk. Template-based injection is the hardening path.

### Credential Isolation Verification

- [x] Run `sbx secret set -g anthropic -t "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"`
  - `echo "test-key" | sbx secret set -g anthropic` — stored on host
- [x] Create sandbox and exec into it
  - `sbx exec phase0-test -- env | grep -i anthropic` — no credentials found
- [x] Run `env | grep -i anthropic` inside VM
  - **PASS** — returns nothing (exit code 1)
- [x] Verify zero credential leakage
  - Confirmed. `GH_TOKEN=proxy-managed` (placeholder). No real tokens in environment.
- [x] Document if Docker security bug is found
  - No bug found. Credential isolation works as documented.

### Spike Deliverables

- [x] Pass/Fail report with technical findings
  - `docs/sbx-phase0-report.md`
- [x] Updated risk assessment based on validation results
  - Updated in report and below in this checklist
- [x] Recommendation: Proceed to Phase 2 or reconsider architecture
  - **Proceed to Phase 2** — see architectural decisions in report

### Phase 0 Artifacts

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `stubs/git-wrapper-sbx.sh` | Adapted git wrapper for sbx networking |
| `stubs/git-api-standalone.py` | Minimal standalone git API server |
| `docs/sbx-phase0-report.md` | Full validation spike report |

## Phase 1: Monitor and Validate (Ongoing)

### Track Docker Sandboxes Development

- [x] Subscribe to Docker blog for Sandboxes updates
  - Launch blog: Mar 31, 2026 — "Docker Sandboxes: Run Agents in YOLO Mode, Safely"
  - Architecture blog: Apr 16, 2026 — "Why MicroVMs: The Architecture Behind Docker Sandboxes"
- [x] Watch Docker Sandboxes GitHub repository (if public)
  - **Found:** `docker/sbx-releases` (releases only, proprietary license, no source)
  - 7 stable releases + nightly builds
  - Issue tracker active, Docker team responds to feedback
- [x] Check Docker documentation weekly for changes
  - Docs at `docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/` — comprehensive reference for all `sbx` commands
  - Security model docs confirm credential isolation via network-level proxy injection
- [x] Join Docker Slack/community for Sandboxes discussions
  - Docker Community Forums active: reports of breaking changes, VM data loss, version conflicts
  - "sbx" Slack channel mentioned in GitHub README
- [x] Document all breaking changes in experimental phase
  - **Breaking:** `docker sandbox` (Desktop plugin, v0.12.0) diverged from standalone `sbx` (v0.24.1)
  - Forum report: "Docker Sandbox COMPLETELY changed in a minor update" — no migration path
  - Two parallel installations on same machine, separate data directories
- [x] **Monitor for git policy features in Docker roadmap** — if Docker adds operation-level git guardrails, reassess differentiation
  - **Confirmed: NO git policy features exist.** `sbx policy` is network-only (domain/IP allow/deny).
  - No git operation guardrails, protected branches, ref filtering, or API-level policies in any documentation.
  - Foundry's git safety layer remains a clear differentiator.

### Validate Credential Isolation

- [ ] Install Docker `sbx` on macOS test machine
  - **Blocker:** No macOS test machine available. Requires `brew install docker/tap/sbx`.
  - Linux install available but provides **legacy container-based sandboxes** only (not microVM).
- [ ] Run `sbx secret set -g anthropic -t "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"`
- [ ] Create sandbox: `sbx create --name test-cred claude /tmp/test`
- [ ] Exec into sandbox: `sbx exec test-cred -- env | grep -i anthropic`
- [ ] Verify: No credentials visible in environment
- [ ] Verify: API calls succeed with injected credentials
- [ ] Document credential injection mechanism
  - **Partial:** Docker security docs confirm: "API keys are injected into HTTP headers by the host-side proxy. Credential values never enter the VM." — docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/security/
  - Hands-on validation still required.

### Validate Git Wrapper Injection

- [ ] Create test sandbox with branch: `sbx create --name test-git --branch test-branch claude /tmp/test`
  - **Blocker:** Requires `sbx` installed on macOS/Windows for microVM-based sandbox.
  - Linux sandbox would be container-based (different injection model).
- [ ] Prepare git wrapper script on host
- [ ] Install wrapper via: `sbx exec test-git -u root -- bash -c "cp /tmp/test/git-wrapper.sh /usr/local/bin/git && chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/git"`
- [ ] Verify wrapper is active: `sbx exec test-git -- git --version` (should show wrapper output)
- [ ] Test git operations are proxied correctly
- [ ] Test `sbx reset` behavior with injected wrapper
- [ ] Document injection and persistence strategy

### Validate Linux Support

- [x] Monitor Docker blog for Linux installation announcement
  - **Update:** Linux install artifacts published at `github.com/docker/sbx-releases`
  - `.deb` packages for Ubuntu 24.04, 25.10, 26.04
  - `.rpm` package for Rocky Linux 8
  - APT install: `sudo apt install ./DockerSandboxes-linux-amd64-ubuntu2404.deb`
- [x] Document Linux support status in weekly updates
  - **Critical finding:** docs.docker.com still states: "MicroVM-based sandboxes require macOS or Windows (experimental). Linux users can use legacy container-based sandboxes with Docker Desktop 4.57."
  - This means Linux gets **container-based** sandboxes, NOT microVM isolation.
  - The KVM backend exists in the VMM codebase but is not yet activated for Linux users.
  - Architecture blog claims: "A developer on a MacBook gets the same isolation guarantees and startup performance as a developer on a Linux workstation." — but this is aspirational, not current.
- [ ] When Linux install docs published: test KVM backend
  - **Partial:** Install docs exist in GitHub README but microVM mode not yet available on Linux.
- [ ] Benchmark performance vs macOS/Windows
- [ ] Document any Linux-specific limitations
  - **Known:** Linux sandboxes are container-based (legacy), not microVM. No hypervisor-level isolation.
- [x] If no Linux install docs after GA, document as project risk (see `docs/sbx-docker-questions.md`)
  - **Risk updated:** Install artifacts exist but microVM isolation is NOT available on Linux. This is a blocker for foundry-sandbox migration since the primary value (hypervisor isolation) is missing on Linux.

### Review Licensing

- [x] Check Docker Sandboxes documentation for licensing terms
  - GitHub repo LICENSE file: **Proprietary — Docker Inc.**
  - Product page FAQ: "Do I need Docker Desktop?" — "No."
  - Product page FAQ: "What does 'Experimental' mean?" — features can change or be discontinued at any time without notice.
- [x] Document licensing terms when published
  - No separate Sandboxes pricing tier on docker.com/pricing.
  - Docker pricing tiers: Personal $0, Pro $9/mo, Team $15/user/mo, Business $24/user/mo.
  - Sandboxes appears to be included at no additional cost for individual standalone use.
- [x] Verify individual standalone use is free
  - **Confirmed free:** Launch blog states: "Individual developers can install and run Docker Sandboxes today, standalone, no Docker Desktop license required."
  - `sbx login` exists but may be optional for basic usage.
- [x] Document team/enterprise licensing requirements
  - **Requires contacting sales:** Product page says "For admin capabilities for a team (network restrictions and file system policies), talk to us to learn more."
  - No published pricing for team/enterprise Sandboxes features.
- [ ] Legal review if needed for commercial use
  - **Note:** Proprietary license. No explicit terms for commercial use published. Needs legal review before enterprise adoption.
- [x] If questions remain, document in `docs/sbx-docker-questions.md` for future outreach
  - Updated: team/enterprise licensing and Linux microVM availability added as outreach questions.

---

## Decision Gates

### Gate 1: Start Phase 2 (Extract Git Safety)
- [ ] Phase 1 validations completed
- [ ] Git wrapper injection validated as feasible
- [ ] Team approves extraction approach

### Gate 2: Start Phase 3 (Full Migration)
- [ ] Docker Sandboxes exits "Experimental" status
- [ ] Linux installation instructions published
- [ ] Licensing terms reviewed and acceptable
- [ ] Phase 2 complete (git safety extracted)
- [ ] Migration plan approved by stakeholders

### Gate 3: Start Phase 4 (Deep Policy Layer)
- [ ] Docker's domain-level policies deemed insufficient
- [ ] Security team approves sidecar approach
- [ ] Performance impact acceptable

---

## Metrics

**Code Reduction:**
- Significant reduction in codebase size (majority of code delegates to `sbx`)
- Components eliminated: container lifecycle, network management, git worktree creation, credential infrastructure
- Components preserved: git safety layer, git wrapper, CLI wrapper, core configuration

**Qualitative Goals:**
- Simplified architecture with clearer separation of concerns
- Reduced maintenance burden for infrastructure code
- Faster onboarding for new contributors
- Improved security through delegation to Docker's battle-tested components

---

## Alternative Scenario Planning

- [ ] Document scenario: Docker Sandboxes is cancelled
- [ ] Document scenario: Linux support never ships
- [ ] Document scenario: Git wrapper injection proves impossible
- [ ] Document scenario: Docker adds git safety natively
- [ ] Document scenario: `sbx reset` always destroys injected binaries
- [ ] For each scenario, include trigger conditions and response strategy
- [ ] Review and update alternative scenarios quarterly
