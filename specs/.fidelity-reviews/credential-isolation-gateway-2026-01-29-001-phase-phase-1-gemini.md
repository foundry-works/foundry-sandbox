# Fidelity Review: credential-isolation-gateway

**Spec ID:** credential-isolation-gateway-2026-01-29-001
**Scope:** phase (phase: phase-1)
**Verdict:** pass
**Date:** 2026-01-31T12:10:13.260156
**Provider:** gemini

## Summary

Phase 1 is successfully implemented. The dangerous path blocklist is active, the validation logic correctly handles symlinks and nesting, and the CLI integration provides the required safety checks and bypass mechanism.

## Requirement Alignment
**Status:** yes

All tasks (1-1 to 1-5) are implemented. DANGEROUS_PATHS array matches spec. validate_mount_path handles canonicalization and relationship checks. new.sh integrates validation and adds the override flag.

## Success Criteria
**Status:** yes

Verified: dangerous paths blocked, symlinks resolved, error messages clear, override flag bypasses check, unit tests pass.

## Test Coverage
**Status:** sufficient

tests/test_validate.sh covers all validation scenarios (direct, symlink, parent, child, safe). CLI flag logic is verified by inspection.

## Code Quality

Implementation follows project shell scripting standards. Canonicalization uses realpath -m correctly.


## Documentation
**Status:** adequate

CLI help text updated in commands/new.sh.
