# Fidelity Review: credential-isolation-gateway

**Spec ID:** credential-isolation-gateway-2026-01-29-001
**Scope:** phase (phase: phase-0)
**Verdict:** unknown
**Date:** 2026-01-31T12:08:12.534778
**Provider:** codex

## Summary

Unable to access repository files due to enforced read-only sandbox restrictions in this session. The referenced spec file is reported as missing in the prompt, and no implementation artifacts could be inspected. As a result, alignment, verification, test coverage, code quality, and documentation cannot be confirmed.

## Requirement Alignment
**Status:** partial

Cannot verify implementation against spec because the spec artifact is missing and repository files could not be read in this session.

## Success Criteria
**Status:** partial

Verification steps referenced in journal entries cannot be validated; tests were not run or inspected.

## Deviations

- **[HIGH]** Spec artifact `specs/pending/credential-isolation-gateway-2026-01-29-001.json` is missing per provided context, preventing review of requirements.
  - Justification: Prompt explicitly lists the file as not found.

## Test Coverage
**Status:** insufficient

Only journal note indicates tests exist; no access to test files or results to confirm coverage or pass status.

## Code Quality

Need repository access or file contents to assess maintainability or risks.

- Implementation not inspected; quality and security review not possible under current access constraints.

## Documentation
**Status:** inadequate

Cannot confirm documentation updates; spec file missing and docs not accessible in this session.

## Issues

- Spec file missing, blocking requirement validation.
- Repository files inaccessible due to sandbox restrictions, preventing implementation review.
- Test evidence unverified beyond journal note.

## Recommendations

- Provide the missing spec JSON or a copy of its contents for review.
- Grant read access to the repository or paste relevant implementation files (e.g., scripts, docs, tests) for assessment.
- Provide test logs or the test file contents to confirm coverage and pass status.
