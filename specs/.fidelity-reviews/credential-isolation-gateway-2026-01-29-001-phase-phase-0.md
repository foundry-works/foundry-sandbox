# Fidelity Review: credential-isolation-gateway

**Spec ID:** credential-isolation-gateway-2026-01-29-001
**Scope:** phase (phase: phase-0)
**Verdict:** partial
**Date:** 2026-01-31T12:08:43.899974

## Summary

The two reviews disagree: gemini reports Phase 0 design/documentation artifacts are complete and the spec moved to active, while codex could not verify anything due to missing spec artifact and inability to inspect repository files/tests in its session. Overall, Phase 0 completion cannot be independently confirmed from the provided evidence.

## Requirement Alignment
**Status:** partial

Gemini states the Phase 0 integration constraints and proxy routing design requirements are fully captured in spec metadata; codex cannot verify alignment because it reports the spec artifact is missing and repository files were inaccessible in its environment.

## Success Criteria
**Status:** partial

Gemini asserts Phase 0 success criteria are met for documenting integration constraints and proxy routing design; codex cannot validate any completion or verification evidence (including tests) due to missing/inaccessible artifacts.

## Deviations

- **[HIGH]** Spec artifact missing/inaccessible, blocking requirement validation against `credential-isolation-gateway-2026-01-29-001`.
  - Justification: Codex reports `specs/pending/credential-isolation-gateway-2026-01-29-001.json` as missing and indicates repository contents could not be inspected, preventing validation of documented requirements and any implementation claims.

## Test Coverage
**Status:** insufficient

Codex could not inspect or validate tests/results and labels coverage insufficient; gemini treats Phase 0 as documentation (not_applicable) but also references Phase 1 tests as passing without providing artifacts here. Net: test evidence for this synthesis is not verifiable from the provided inputs.

## Code Quality

Gemini reports no code-quality issues for Phase 0 (documentation-focused), while codex indicates it could not review any implementation artifacts; therefore code quality cannot be confidently assessed from these inputs.

- Implementation/code quality could not be inspected due to access constraints (codex).

## Documentation
**Status:** inadequate

Gemini states documentation in spec metadata is adequate and that the spec moved to active; codex cannot confirm any documentation updates due to reported missing/inaccessible spec/artifacts. From the synthesis perspective, documentation adequacy is not independently verifiable from the provided evidence set.

## Issues

- Spec file reported missing/inaccessible, blocking validation (codex; single).
- Repository files inaccessible in one review environment, preventing independent assessment of alignment, docs, and tests (codex; single).
- Test pass/coverage evidence not directly inspectable within the provided inputs (codex; single; gemini references passing tests without artifacts).

## Recommendations

- Provide the spec JSON contents (or ensure it is accessible) for `credential-isolation-gateway-2026-01-29-001` so reviewers can validate Phase 0 requirements and documentation.
- Provide accessible artifacts for verification: relevant spec metadata sections, docs, and (if referenced) test files/logs proving Phase 1 checks passed.
- Proceed with planned next steps only after artifact accessibility is resolved (e.g., formalize design into `docs/security/network-isolation.md` and continue Phase 2 gateway service work), to avoid unverified progress.

## Verdict Consensus

- **pass:** gemini
- **unknown:** codex

**Agreement Level:** conflicted

Votes are split (gemini=pass, codex=unknown). Per rules, a split/tie yields final verdict=partial and notes the disagreement.

## Synthesis Metadata

- Models consulted: codex, gemini
- Models succeeded: codex, gemini
- Synthesis provider: gpt-5.2
