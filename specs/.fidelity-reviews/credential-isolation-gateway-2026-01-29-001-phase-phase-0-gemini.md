# Fidelity Review: credential-isolation-gateway

**Spec ID:** credential-isolation-gateway-2026-01-29-001
**Scope:** phase (phase: phase-0)
**Verdict:** pass
**Date:** 2026-01-31T12:08:12.535412
**Provider:** gemini

## Summary

The Integration Model phase (Phase 0) has been successfully completed. The required documentation for integration constraints and proxy routing design has been added to the specification metadata, strictly adhering to the acceptance criteria. While Phase 1 (Dangerous Path Blocklist) has also been implemented and verified, this review confirms the successful completion of the Phase 0 design artifacts.

## Requirement Alignment
**Status:** yes

The `integration_model` and `proxy_routing_design` sections in the spec metadata fully capture the requirements: api-proxy retention, gateway activation logic, traffic splitting strategy, and the migration path.

## Success Criteria
**Status:** yes

Both 'Document integration constraints' and 'Document proxy routing design' tasks are complete. The spec metadata contains the required definitions for the integration mode and proxy architecture.

## Test Coverage
**Status:** not_applicable

Phase 0 is a documentation/design phase. (Note: Phase 1 tests for path validation were found and passed, confirming progress on the next phase).

## Code Quality

N/A for documentation tasks.


## Documentation
**Status:** adequate

The design is comprehensively documented within the spec metadata as requested. The spec file has moved from `pending` to `active`.

## Recommendations

- Proceed to formalize the design into `docs/security/network-isolation.md` during Phase 3 as planned.
- Continue with Phase 2 (Gateway Service) implementation.
