# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.13.0] - 2026-02-12

### Changed
- **Complete Python CLI migration** - Removed legacy `sandbox.sh` shell entrypoint and `lib/container_config.sh`; `cast` (Python CLI) is now the sole entry point
- **CI simplified** - Removed shell/python matrix strategy from orchestration tests since only Python CLI remains
- **Documentation updated** - All references to `sandbox.sh` replaced with `cast`/Python CLI across docs, compose files, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and README
- **PyPI publishing** - Added package metadata (`authors`, `readme`, `classifiers`, `urls`) and automated publish-to-PyPI job in release workflow using trusted publishing

### Removed
- `sandbox.sh` - Legacy shell entrypoint (fully replaced by `cast`)
- `lib/container_config.sh` - Shell-based container configuration (fully replaced by `foundry_sandbox/container_setup.py`)

## [0.12.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **Self-merge prevention** - Blocks sandbox from merging its own PRs via REST API (`PUT /pulls/*/merge`, `PUT /pulls/*/auto-merge`), GraphQL mutations (`mergePullRequest`, `enablePullRequestAutoMerge`, `disablePullRequestAutoMerge`), and request body inspection (`event: APPROVE`, `state: open`)
- **Workflow push blocking** - Prevents pushes containing `.github/workflows` or GitHub Actions files that could modify CI/CD pipelines, with restricted-path checks using temp bare repos and `git diff-tree`
- **Push rate limiting** - Per-container token bucket rate limiter for git push operations to prevent resource exhaustion from rapid push attempts (configurable via `PUSH_RATE_CAPACITY` and `PUSH_RATE_REFILL_PER_SEC`)
- **GraphQL comment stripping** - Strips `# comment` lines from GraphQL queries before mutation regex matching, preventing bypass via comments between mutation names and opening parentheses
- **Path traversal hardening** - Added `os.path.realpath()` validation and `/` component checks in container identity addon to catch URL-encoded traversal, unicode normalization, and symlink attacks
- **Red-team test extensions** - New sections in `redteam-sandbox.sh` for self-merge prevention, workflow push blocking, and PR reopen attack vectors
- **Dual-layer consistency tests** - New test suite (`test_dual_layer_consistency.py`) validating that policy engine and GitHub API filter agree on blocking decisions
- **Git operations unit tests** - New test suite (`test_git_operations.py`) for command parsing edge cases

### Changed
- **Fail-closed on unparseable bodies** - GraphQL requests with malformed JSON are now blocked instead of allowed through, preventing parser-differential attacks
- **Fail-closed on push metadata gaps** - Push operations missing container config or repo metadata are denied instead of allowed
- **HTTP method normalization** - Policy engine and GitHub API filter now normalize `flow.request.method` to uppercase, preventing bypass via lowercase HTTP methods (`put`, `delete`, etc.)
- **Case-insensitive PR reopen detection** - REST API filter now uses case-insensitive comparison for `state: open` to block `OPEN`, `Open`, etc.
- **Read-only filesystem restored** - Credential-isolation sandboxes use a combined CA bundle (`/certs/ca-certificates.crt`) generated by the proxy instead of running `update-ca-certificates`, allowing `read_only: true` in Docker compose
- **Proxy-side git hook prevention** - `--no-verify` flag injected by the proxy for push operations, complementing the client-side `core.hooksPath=/dev/null` defense
- **Temp dir cleanup logging** - `shutil.rmtree` failures in restricted-path checks now log warnings instead of being silently ignored
- **Entrypoint fail-fast** - `generate_ca_cert()` in unified-proxy entrypoint now detects if mitmdump dies before producing the CA certificate

### Fixed
- **Test mock pollution** - Removed per-test-file `sys.modules["mitmproxy"]` overwrites that polluted the global module cache and broke cross-file test runs; all tests now use shared conftest.py mocks

## [0.11.1] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **GitHub HTTPS credential injection** - Added `github.com` to the credential injector provider map so git push/pull/clone over HTTPS through the proxy are authenticated with `GITHUB_TOKEN` (or `GH_TOKEN` fallback)
- **Credential injector unit tests** - New test suite (`tests/unit/test_credential_injector.py`) covering github.com injection, GH_TOKEN fallback, unauthenticated passthrough, placeholder stripping, and non-GitHub host handling
- **MockHeaders helper** - Case-insensitive mock headers class in `conftest.py` for realistic mitmproxy header behavior in tests

### Fixed
- **Git push/pull authentication** - `FOUNDRY_PROXY_GIT_TOKEN` is now passed through the sanitized subprocess environment in `build_clean_env()`, fixing authentication failures for git push/pull/fetch operations through the proxy

## [0.11.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Branch Isolation** - Complete cross-sandbox branch isolation in the git proxy, preventing sandboxes from reading, diffing, cherry-picking, or enumerating other sandboxes' branches
  - **Branch isolation validator** with ref validation, subcommand parsing, and deny-by-default enforcement for checkout/switch, fetch/pull, worktree add, bisect, reflog, notes, and ref-reading commands
  - **Output filtering** hides other sandboxes' branches from `git branch`, `for-each-ref`, `ls-remote`, `show-ref`, and `log --decorate` output
  - **SHA reachability enforcement** blocks unreachable SHAs in ref-reading commands with per-request memoization and shallow repo skip
  - **Enhanced notes isolation** checking positional ref args and `--ref` flag
  - **Server-side fetch locking** with bare repo resolver (`_resolve_bare_repo_path`) and `fcntl.flock` exclusive locking to serialize concurrent fetch/pull operations per bare repo
  - **Branch cleanup on sandbox destroy and prune** - safely deletes sandbox branches from the bare repo, skipping well-known branches and branches still in use by other worktrees
  - **Sandbox branch identity** passed to proxy metadata in `new.sh` and `start.sh` with fail-closed enforcement for legacy sandboxes without branch identity
- **Sparse checkout proxy support** - allows `git sparse-checkout list` through proxy with read-only enforcement; adds `core.sparseCheckout`/`core.sparseCheckoutCone` to permitted config keys
- **Comprehensive test suite for branch isolation**
  - Unit tests (96): subcommand extraction, rev suffix stripping, branch name validation, ref validation, `validate_branch_isolation`, output filtering
  - Integration tests (34): cross-sandbox blocking and filtering end-to-end
  - Security regression tests (12): leak channel coverage for reflog, notes, for-each-ref, log decorations, branch -a, show-ref
- **Structured plan documentation** under `docs/plans/branch-isolation/` with per-phase implementation details

### Fixed
- **Push protection** now uses `_resolve_bare_repo_path()` instead of unpopulated metadata field, with default branch detection from bare repo HEAD
- **`repositoryformatversion`** bumped to 1 so git extensions like `worktreeConfig` are recognized; applied in both host-side `configure_sparse_checkout()` and proxy-side `fix_proxy_worktree_paths()`
- **VirtioFS stale inode** workaround - defensive `cat` refresh on bare repo config and re-set of `extensions.worktreeConfig` in the proxy
- **Sandbox creation bugs** from git policy hardening phases 4-6: missing git package in unified-proxy Dockerfile, replaced tmpfs `.git` overlay with `/dev/null` bind mount for worktree support, fixed addon validation matching, added git identity configuration and `/workspace` path translation in proxy

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **Git Policy Hardening** - six-phase security hardening for git operations in sandboxes
  - **Phase 1: Git hook prevention** - Disables git hooks via `core.hooksPath=/dev/null`, `core.fsmonitor=false`; controlled by `SANDBOX_GIT_HOOKS_ENABLED` env var
  - **Phase 2: Protected branch enforcement** - Blocks direct pushes to `main`, `master`, `release/*`, `production` with fnmatch pattern support and atomic bootstrap lock
  - **Phase 3: .git/ shadow mode isolation** - Hides `.git/` metadata behind tmpfs overlay; all git operations proxied through HTTP API with HMAC-SHA256 authentication
    - `stubs/git-wrapper.sh` - Shell wrapper intercepting git commands with signal handling, 30s timeout, fail-closed on errors
    - `unified-proxy/git_api.py` - HTTP API (port 8083) for git command execution
    - `unified-proxy/git_operations.py` - Deny-by-default command allowlist with per-operation flag validation, path traversal prevention, 10MB output limit
  - **Phase 4: GitHub API endpoint path enforcement** - Blocks dangerous API paths (webhooks, deploy keys, secrets, actions) with segment-aware matching and path normalization
  - **Phase 5: PR/issue operation controls** - Blocks closing PRs/issues via PATCH with JSON body inspection; fail-closed on malformed/streaming bodies
  - **Phase 6: Auto-track new branches** - Configures tracking on branch creation so `git push` works without `--set-upstream`
- **Git policy hardening spec** and implementation plan documentation
- **Security test suite** for git policy enforcement (`tests/security/test_git_policy.py`)
- **Unit tests** for git wrapper, git operations, and git proxy components

### Fixed
- **Prune command** now treats stopped containers as prunable (previously only removed exited containers)
- **Orphaned Docker network cleanup** improved in prune command with better detection logic

  - DNS default-deny mode: dnsmasq blocks all domains by default, only forwards allowlisted domains
  - Both layers share the same `firewall-allowlist.generated` configuration
  - Prevents data exfiltration to arbitrary external services

### Changed
- **DNS security hardening**: dnsmasq now uses `no-resolv` and `address=/#/` to block all unallowlisted domains
- DNS queries forwarded to Docker's internal DNS (127.0.0.11) instead of upstream resolvers
- Added DNS query logging for security auditing
- **Default credential isolation**: `--isolate-credentials` is now the default behavior

- **Codex OAuth endpoint**: Updated from `auth0.openai.com` to `auth.openai.com`
- **Firewall architecture**: Simplified to wildcard DNS filtering mode (replaced rotating IP domain handling)
- **Gateway socket location**: Moved from `/tmp` to `~/.foundry-sandbox/sockets/` for Docker Desktop macOS compatibility
- Gateway socket now uses bind mount instead of named volume for host accessibility

### Removed
- **Full network mode**: `--network=full` has been removed for security reasons
  - Available modes: `limited` (default), `host-only`, `none`
  - Attempting to use `full` mode shows a helpful error message
- **Runtime domain additions**: `sudo network-mode allow <domain>` has been disabled

  - Token validation interception for placeholder tokens (tokeninfo, userinfo)
  - Support for `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` initialization endpoint

### Fixed
- Clear `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` env vars when OAuth is configured to prevent API key auth override
- Fixed tokeninfo validation to check Authorization header (google-auth-library sends token there)
- Reordered OAuth handlers so Gemini has priority over OpenCode for Google APIs

## [0.5.8] - 2026-01-29

### Changed
- Credential isolation refactored from transparent to explicit proxy mode

  - Pip requirements automatically re-installed on `cast start`/`cast attach`
  - Configuration persisted in sandbox metadata for session restoration

### Changed

  - Any file deletion now requires human operator approval

### Fixed
- Sparse worktree detection: sets `core.worktree` config for `--no-checkout` sparse worktrees

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-22

### Added
- Monorepo support with `--wd <path>` flag to set working directory within repo
- Sparse checkout support with `--sparse` flag (only checkouts working directory + root configs)
- Container tmux sessions now start in the specified working directory

### Changed
- Foundry MCP config path changed from `~/.foundry-mcp.toml` to `~/.config/foundry-mcp/config.toml`
- Foundry MCP specs directories now created relative to working directory when `--wd` is used
- Permissions module now uses `~/.claude/settings.json` instead of `/workspace/.claude/settings.local.json`

### Fixed
- Docker daemon timeout check now uses gtimeout/timeout command instead of manual implementation

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-22

### Added
- `.env.example` template for API key configuration
- `lib/permissions.sh` module for installing foundry permissions into workspace `.claude/settings.local.json`
- `docs/configuration.md` consolidating configuration reference (API keys, plugins, config file mappings)
- `.foundry-mcp.toml` config file sync from host to container
- Automatic creation of foundry-mcp workspace directories (`/workspace/specs/*`, `~/.foundry-mcp/*`)
- Git retry logic with exponential backoff for network resilience
- Sandbox name collision detection to prevent overwriting existing sandboxes
- `sanitize_ref_component()` function for generating valid git branch names
- `codexdsp` alias for `codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`

### Changed
- API keys are now passed via environment variables instead of file sync
- Updated documentation for environment variable-based credential management
- Installer no longer creates a git repository in `~/.foundry-sandbox`; files are synced directly, eliminating update conflicts from local modifications
- README simplified; detailed usage, config, and architecture content moved to docs
- Branch naming now uses `{user}/{repo}-{timestamp}` format instead of `sandbox/{repo}-{timestamp}`
- Sandbox naming simplified to use branch name only (without repo prefix)
- Renamed `cdsp` alias to `claudedsp` for clarity

### Removed
- `--with-api-keys` and `--no-api-keys` CLI flags
- `~/.api_keys` file sync functionality
- `SANDBOX_SYNC_API_KEYS` configuration variable
- `cdspr` alias (use `claudedsp --resume` instead)
